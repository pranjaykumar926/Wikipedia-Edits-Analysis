## Introduction

Wikipedia is among the most actively edited and accessed online encyclopedias. This project is designed to examine patterns in Wikipedia edits with a specific focus on language and geographical distribution. Key objectives include:

* Analyzing the **spatial distribution** of Wikipedia contributions
* Studying **temporal trends** in edit activity
* Investigating **language-wise differences** in contributions
* Delivering **visual insights** through interactive and static representations

---

## Project Features

* Multilingual edit activity analysis
* Geospatial mapping of contributions
* Temporal trend evaluation (hourly, daily, monthly)
* Clean and structured visualizations using industry-standard libraries
* Optimized preprocessing pipeline for large-scale datasets

---

## Data Sources

* **Wikipedia Public API:** For edit history and metadata
* **Open Wikipedia Contribution Datasets:** To enrich regional analysis
* **Geo-IP Databases:** For mapping user IPs to locations

---

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python 3.x
* **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Geospatial Mapping:** GeoPandas, Folium
* **API Integration:** MediaWiki (Wikipedia) API

## Visualizations and Key Insights

* **Global Heatmaps** displaying edit concentrations
* **Time-Series Plots** revealing activity patterns by hour/day/month
* **Language Distribution Graphs** highlighting editorial focus per language
* **Top Contributors & Most Edited Articles** statistics

---

## Planned Enhancements

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) for semantic content analysis
* Deployment of a live dashboard with real-time edit tracking
* Integration of machine learning to detect unusual edit patterns
* Expanded data coverage with historical archive parsing
